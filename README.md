# SPS---Smart-Parking-System
The parking lot designed here has three slots, each equipped with an ultrasonic sensor.The length and width of each slot is chosen based on the average length and width of a car such that the car will be having at most 1 metre distance between it and the wall.Ultrasonic sensor is preferred over IR sensor because it would be hard to receive signals from an IR sensor if the car parked is black in colour or is dirty.A LCD display is used in front of the driveway for the driver to check for free slots to park the car or to drive to the next parking lot if its full.The LCD screen shows total number of cars parked, number of free slots and information about occupancy of each slot
